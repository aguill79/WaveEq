# WaveEq
Mainly for CPE 512 final project: a parallel implementation for solving the 2D wave equation

This will contain a few different implementations. By the end, it should contain:
- Python implementations for 1D and 2D waves
- C implementations for 1D and 2D waves
- Parallel C implementation for 2D waves
- (potentially) Python scripts for visualizing Parallel C implementation
